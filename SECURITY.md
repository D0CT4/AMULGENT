# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

**Note:** As AMULGENT is currently in early development (version 0.1.x), we are committed to addressing security issues promptly. Once we reach version 1.0, we will maintain security support for the current major version and the previous major version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of AMULGENT seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Navigate to the [Security tab](https://github.com/D0CT4/AMULGENT/security)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

2. **Email**
   - Send an email to the repository maintainer through GitHub
   - Use the subject line: "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"
   - Include detailed information about the vulnerability

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit it
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue

### Response Timeline

You can expect the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of submission
- **Confirmation**: Within 7 days, we will confirm the vulnerability or request additional information
- **Status Updates**: We will provide regular updates every 7 days until the issue is resolved
- **Resolution**: We aim to release a patch within 30 days for critical vulnerabilities

### Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure principles:

1. The security report is received and assigned to a handler
2. The problem is confirmed and affected versions are determined
3. Code is audited to find any similar problems
4. Fixes are prepared for all supported releases
5. The fix is released and a security advisory is published

**We request that you:**
- Give us reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service interruption
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it

## Security Best Practices for Users

### General Security Guidelines

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade aimulgent
   pip list --outdated
   ```

2. **Use Virtual Environments**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install aimulgent
   ```

3. **Verify Package Integrity**
   - Always install from trusted sources (PyPI official repository)
   - Check package hashes when available
   - Review the `requirements.txt` for unexpected dependencies

4. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user inputs
   - Use the built-in validation methods provided by AMULGENT
   - Be cautious with data from untrusted sources

### Secure Configuration

1. **API Keys and Secrets**
   - Never hardcode API keys or secrets in your code
   - Use environment variables or secure secret management systems
   - Ensure `.env` files are in `.gitignore`

   ```python
   import os
   from aimulgent.core.config import Config
   
   config = Config()
   # Use environment variables for sensitive data
   api_key = os.environ.get('AMULGENT_API_KEY')
   ```

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Regularly review access permissions

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS, TLS)
   - Implement proper data retention policies

### Secure Development Practices

1. **Code Reviews**
   - Conduct security-focused code reviews
   - Use automated security scanning tools
   - Follow secure coding guidelines

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like `safety` and `bandit`:
   ```bash
   pip install safety bandit
   safety check
   bandit -r aimulgent/
   ```

3. **Testing**
   - Include security test cases
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
   - Perform regular penetration testing

### LLM/SLM Specific Security

Since AMULGENT works with Language Models, consider these additional precautions:

1. **Prompt Injection Protection**
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs to language models
   - Implement input length limits
   - Use context isolation where appropriate

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Be aware of what data is sent to language models
   - Implement data anonymization where necessary
   - Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

3. **Output Validation**
   - Validate and sanitize model outputs
   - Implement content filtering if necessary
   - Monitor for unexpected or malicious outputs

4. **Token and Energy Optimization**
   - Use AMULGENT's HRM reasoning to minimize token usage
   - Monitor API usage and set appropriate limits
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Security Features in AMULGENT

### Built-in Security Measures

1. **Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)**
   - Reduces attack surface by minimizing unnecessary token usage
   - Implements tiered security checks at each reasoning level

2. **Workflow Transparency**
   - Clear visualization of data flow
   - Audit trail for security analysis
   - Easy identification of potential security issues

3. **Agent Isolation**
   - Each agent operates in a controlled environment
   - Limited inter-agent communication
   - Reduced risk of cascading failures

### Security Testing

AMULGENT includes security tests in the test suite:

```bash
# Run security-focused tests
pytest tests/test_security.py

# Run static security analysis
bandit -r aimulgent/ -ll

# Check dependencies for known vulnerabilities
safety check
```

## Vulnerability Response Process

### For Maintainers

1. **Triage** (Within 48 hours)
   - Acknowledge receipt of the report
   - Assess severity and impact
   - Assign a handler if not already done

2. **Investigation** (Within 7 days)
   - Reproduce the vulnerability
   - Identify root cause
   - Determine affected versions
   - Assess potential impact

3. **Development** (Ongoing)
   - Develop and test fix
   - Ensure fix doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities
   - Prepare documentation and advisory

4. **Release** (As soon as ready)
   - Release patched version(s)
   - Publish security advisory
   - Notify affected users
   - Credit researcher (if desired)

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels:

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, privilege escalation, or data breach
- **High**: Significant security impact, but with mitigating factors
- **Medium**: Security impact with limited scope or likelihood
- **Low**: Minor security issues with minimal impact
